2. **SubEntity** - Select a Multibanco SubEntity. You can only choose one of the Multibanco SubEntities associated with the Entity chosen earlier.
3. **Deadline** - Select the number of days the Multibanco reference will be valid. Leaving this field empty will mean that the Multibanco reference does not expire.

Examples of deadlines:

- Choosing a deadline of 1 day: If an order is created on 22/03/2023 at 9:30, the generated Multibanco reference will expire on 23/03/2023 at 23:59, which means the Multibanco reference will be valid for the day it was generated plus 1 day.
- Choosing a deadline of 3 days: If an order is created on 22/03/2023 at 20:30, the generated Multibanco reference will expire on 25/03/2023 at 23:59, which means the Multibanco reference will be valid for the day it was generated plus 3 days.

# Other


## Request additional account

If you already have an ifthenpay account but haven't contracted a needed payment method, you can place an automatic request with ifthenpay.
The response time for this request is 1 to 2 business days, with the exception of the Credit Card payment method, which might exceed this time due to validation requirements.
To request the creation of an additional account, access the configuration page of the payment method you wish to contract and click on Request ... Account (1).
![img](assets/request_account.png)
</br>

In the case that you already have a Multibanco account with static references and need an account for Multibanco with dynamic references, you can do so on the Multibanco configuration page by clicking on the Request Dynamic Multibanco Account button (1) at the bottom of the page.
![img](assets/request_account_multibanco_dynamic.png)
</br>

You may also request a method for the Ifthenpay Gateway following the same procedure by clicking button (1). 
![img](assets/request_gateway_payment_method.png)
</br>


As a result, the ifthenpay team will add the payment method to your account, updating the list of available payment methods in your extension.

IMPORTANT: When requesting an account for the Credit Card payment method, the ifthenpay team will contact you to request more information about your online store and your business before activating the payment method.

</br>

## Reset Configuration

This functionality allows you to reset the configuration of the payment method and is useful in the following scenarios:

- If you have acquired a new Backoffice Key and want to assign it to your website, but you already have one currently assigned.
- If you have requested the creation of an additional account by phone or ticket and want to update the list of payment methods to use the new account.
- If you want to reset the configuration of the payment method to reconfigure it.

In the configuration of the selected payment method, click on the Reset Configuration button (1) and confirm the action by clicking OK.

**Attention, this action will clear the current payment method configuration**;

![img](assets/clear_configuration.png)
</br>

After clearing the configuration, you will be prompted to enter the Backoffice Key again.
![img](assets/cleared_configuration.png)

</br>

## Callback

IMPORTANT: Only the Multibanco, MB WAY, Payshop, Cofidis Pay, and Ifthenpay Gateway payment methods allow activating the Callback. The Credit Card method changes the order status automatically without using the Callback.

The Callback is a feature that, when enabled, allows your store to receive notifications of successful payments. Upon receiving a successful payment for an order, the ifthenpay server communicates with your store, changing the order status to "Processing." You can use ifthenpay payments without activating the Callback, but your orders won't automatically update their status.

As mentioned in the configurations above, to activate the Callback, access the extension's configuration page and enable the "Enable Callback" option. After saving the settings, the process of associating your store and payment method with ifthenpay's servers will run, and a new "Callback" group (for information only) will appear, showing the Callback status (1), the anti-phishing key (2), and the Callback URL (3).

After activating the Callback, you don't need to take any further action. The Callback is active and functioning.

![img](assets/callback.png)

</br>

## Test Callback

On each payment method configuration page (except for Credit Card), you can test the Callback functionality by clicking the "Test Callback" button. This action will simulate a successful payment for an order in your store, changing its status. You need to have the Callback active to access this functionality.

</br>

![img](assets/test_callback_form_ifthenpaygateway.png)

</br>

## Cronjob

A cron job is a scheduled task that is automatically executed at specific intervals in the system. The ifthenpay extension provides a cron job to check the payment status and cancel orders that haven't been paid within the configured time limit. The table below shows the time limit for each payment method, which the cron job checks and cancels orders that haven't been paid within the time limit. This time limit can be configured only for the Multibanco with Dynamic References and Payshop payment methods.

| Payment Method     | Payment Deadline               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |

## Logs

For easier error detection, the ifthenpay extension logs the errors that occur during its execution. The logs are stored separately by payment method, in a text file at storage/logs/, for example storage/logs/multibanco.log. To access the logs, go to the root of the storage/ folder, navigate to the logs/ folder, and open the file of the payment method that you need to analyze.

Note: The location of the storage folder is defined after the installation of Opencart and may vary for each installation.
